Infinite loop

An infinite loop, as the name suggests, is a loop that will keep running forever. If you accidentally make an infinite loop, it could crash your browser or computer. An example is:

const myNumber = 5;
while(myNumber > 0) {
console.log('hey there!')
}

For loop
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

var txt = "";
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
txt += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
console.log(txt);

for each loop:

The forEach() method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.
